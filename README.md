The fault diagnosis and prognosis of a rotating machine using vibration pattern  analysis, is one of the efficient and most successful techniques. Analytical and  practical understanding of machine vibration is well defined in literatures. The  machine vibration behavior, in time and frequency domain, forms the basis for  monitoring of rotating machines.
