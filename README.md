We have developed this project under the guidance of Prof.R.D.Komati Sir. We have divided the project into 2 parts (a) Hardware Part (b) Software Part. In hardware part we have connected the accelerometer(ADXL335) to Node MCU which will transmit all the data recieved from sensor in all the 3 axis to thingspeak platform and later the data is fetch from thingspeak to Node Red and App. All the working part is attached in our project from FFT graph plotting in MATLAB to JSON in Node RED.                                              You can refer the following video as we have shown the working model of our project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NKksMT_BPNu8ipGoNrB3BhRDeNVpHW4P/view?usp=sharing              To contact us follow us on LinkedIn: (A) SHUBHANGI KUMARI: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhangi-k-607502169   (B) ROHIT RAJ: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-raj-78913613a/
